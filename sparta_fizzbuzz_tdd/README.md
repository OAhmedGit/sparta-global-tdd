# FizzBuzz TDD Homework

Aim of this homework was to create an OOP based program using test driven development where numbers 1 to 100 are printed. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”
